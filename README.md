# Problem Statement

You've lived in the same city for years now and are planning to move to a new one. How can you identify a neighborhood that you'd be happy living in? My project aims to cluster neighborhoods for two given cities and then using this data, a user can identify where they would be happiest living.

# Data

I scraped neighborhood data from wikipedia for Bangalore (the city I'm from) and Minneapolis (the city I moved to). I then augment this data using the Foursquare API to identify places of interest. I then one-hot encode these places into categories and using K-means to cluster neighborhoods together. Using this information I can identify where I'd want to live!
